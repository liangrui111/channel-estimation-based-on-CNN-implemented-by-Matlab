# channel-estimation-based-on-CNN-implemented-by-Matlab
using the Deep Learning Toolbox.
using the fileDatastore to make the input of cnn be .mat .
A case of channel estimation based on convolution network using MATLAB is given.
upsampleLowRes.m is to Used to generate low resolution channels from the true channel data.
ce_data.m is used to make the .mat can be the input of the cnn in matlab .
ce_cnn.m is used to define the structure of the cnn.
ce_test.m is used to measure the accuracy of channel estimation,use the result of LS algorithm as the input of trained cnn.
